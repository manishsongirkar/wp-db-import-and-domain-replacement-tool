# ===============================================
# WordPress Database Import Configuration - Single Site Example
# ===============================================
# This is an example configuration file for single-site WordPress installations.
# Copy this file to your WordPress root directory as 'wpdb-import.conf'
# and customize the settings for your project.
#
# File Location: Place in the same directory as wp-config.php
# Usage: wp-db-import will automatically detect and use this configuration

[general]
# SQL file to import (relative to WordPress root or absolute path)
sql_file=production-database.sql

# Production domain to search for in the database
old_domain=example.com

# Local development domain to replace with
new_domain=example.test

# Include all database tables (recommended for complete imports)
# Set to false to only process WordPress core tables
all_tables=true

# Run in preview mode without making actual changes
# Set to true for testing, false for actual imports
dry_run=false

# Automatically clear post revisions before search-replace
# Improves performance by reducing database size
clear_revisions=true

# Automatically setup Stage File Proxy plugin for media management
# Allows using production media files without downloading them
setup_stage_proxy=true

# Skip confirmation prompts and proceed automatically
# Set to false for safer, interactive operation
auto_proceed=false

[site_mappings]
# Format: blog_id:production_domain:local_domain
# For single sites, blog_id is typically 1

# DUAL PURPOSE - This section serves two functions:
# 1. Domain replacement during database import (production_domain → local_domain)
# 2. Stage File Proxy configuration (uses production_domain as source)

# Example mapping for single site:
# 1:example.com:local.test

# If your database contains the domain 'example.com' and you want to replace it with 'local.test'
# while also using 'example.com' as the Stage File Proxy source domain, use:
# 1:example.com:local.test
